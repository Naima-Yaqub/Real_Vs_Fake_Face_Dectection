# Real_Vs_Fake_Face_Dectection Using CNN
**Overview**
The aim of this project is to build a machine learning model that can classify images as either real or fake faces. This project involves:
**Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
Collecting a dataset of real and fake faces.
Preprocessing images to make them suitable for training.

**Model Building:**
Designing and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classification.

**Evaluation:**
Testing the model's performance on unseen data (created by splitting the exiting dataset).

**Deployment:**
Making the model accessible via a simple interface (future work).

**Features**
Detects real vs fake faces with a CNN-based classifier.
Preprocessing pipeline for cleaning and preparing image data.
Performance metrics including accuracy.

**Requirements**
To run this project, you need:
Python 3.8+
TensorFlow
keras
NumPy
Matplotlib
